# Enhanced Emotional Authenticity & Crisis Detection Test Guide

## üéØ Overview
The MindScope AI Therapist now includes sophisticated emotional authenticity detection and enhanced crisis intervention protocols that can differentiate between genuine concerns and test scenarios while providing appropriate responses for both.

## üîç Emotional Authenticity Detection Features

### Authenticity Scoring System
- **Authentic markers** (+2 points): "heart racing", "can't breathe", "mind racing", "accomplished", "fed up"
- **Test markers** (-2 points): "just testing", "hypothetically", "asking for a friend"
- **Length bonus** (+1 point): Messages over 20 characters show more authenticity
- **Intensity markers** (+1 point): "really", "very" indicate genuine emotion
- **Time urgency** (+2 points): "tonight", "today", "now" increase authenticity for crisis

### Enhanced Emotion Categories
1. **Anxiety**: Includes physiological markers like "heart racing", "can't breathe"
2. **Depression**: Recognizes authentic despair vs casual sadness
3. **Happiness**: Detects suspicious positivity like "everything is perfect"
4. **Anger**: Distinguishes genuine rage from mild irritation
5. **Grief**: Identifies real loss processing vs hypothetical scenarios
6. **Stress**: Separates overwhelm from minor pressure
7. **Trauma**: Recognizes genuine trauma responses vs educational inquiries
