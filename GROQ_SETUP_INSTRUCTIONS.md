# üöÄ Enable Real AI Responses in MindScope

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Your MindScope AI Therapist is configured and ready!**
‚ö†Ô∏è **But you need a real Groq API key to get actual AI responses instead of simulated ones.**

## How to Get Real AI Responses

### Step 1: Get a Groq API Key (FREE!)
1. Go to: https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" in the dashboard
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. Copy your API key (starts with `gsk_...`)

### Step 2: Configure Your API Key
1. Open your `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace this line:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```
   With your actual API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How to Verify It's Working

### Console Logs to Look For:
When the AI Therapist initializes, you should see:
```
üîç AI Therapist Initialization:
- API Key present: true
- API Key valid: true
‚úÖ Real AI responses enabled with Groq API!
```

When generating responses:
```
ü§ñ Generating REAL AI response with Groq API...
üì§ Sending to Groq API: Hello, I'm feeling anxious...
‚úÖ Real AI response received! I hear that you're feeling anxious...
```

### Signs You're Getting Real AI:
- ‚úÖ Responses are contextual and specific to your input
- ‚úÖ Responses vary each time (not predetermined)
- ‚úÖ Conversation flows naturally
- ‚úÖ AI remembers context from previous messages

### Signs You're Still Getting Simulated Responses:
- ‚ùå Generic, predetermined responses
- ‚ùå Same responses for similar inputs
- ‚ùå Console shows: "Using fallback responses"

## AI Model Details
- **Model**: Llama 3 8B (8192 context)
- **Provider**: Groq (Ultra-fast inference)
- **Max Tokens**: 1000 per response
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
- **Free Tier**: 500 requests/minute limit

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Fallback Responses?
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify API key format (should start with `gsk_`)
3. Ensure no extra spaces in .env.local
4. Restart development server after changing API key
5. Check Groq console for usage/quota limits

### API Errors?
- Check your Groq account quota
- Verify API key is active
- Check network connection

## Cost Information
- **Free Tier**: Generous limits for development/testing
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Very affordable for production use
- **No monthly minimums**: Only pay for what you use

## Security Note
- Never commit your actual API key to version control
- Keep .env.local in .gitignore (already configured)
- Use environment variables in production deployment

**üéØ Once configured, your AI Therapist will provide genuine, contextual, and empathetic responses powered by advanced language models!**
