# MindScope — Practical, Deep & Future Q&A

This deck focuses on pragmatic implementation details, scaling, and future roadmap — optimized for tough judge questions.

## 1) Scale & Performance on Low-End Devices

- Answer: We prioritize the PWA app‑shell (precache < 200KB gzipped), lazy‑load heavy modules, and stream data. Images/video use responsive formats (AVIF/WebM) with `srcset`. On 3G targets: P95 TTI < 4s measured via Lighthouse CI and synthetic throttling in Playwright. We gate costly ML to server/edge; client runs only lightweight inference with WASM/WebGL where available.

## 2) Offline Evolution Beyond Cache

- Answer: Today: precache shell + runtime JSON via stale‑while‑revalidate; writes queued with Background Sync. Near‑term: per‑user delta sync and CRDTs for journals to support concurrent edits. IndexedDB schema versioning allows migrations; we include replay IDs for idempotent writes.

## 3) Reliable Sync & Idempotency

- Answer: Each mutation carries a `clientOpId` (UUIDv4) and `lastSyncedAt`. Server upserts on `(userId, clientOpId)` to avoid duplicates; returns authoritative version with vector clock. Retries use exponential backoff; DLQ alerts on repeated conflicts.

## 4) Future of AI Safety Guardrails

- Answer: Confidence‑aware prompts, contradiction checks, and real‑time keyword/risk detectors. We will add RAG over vetted clinical playbooks, multi‑model consensus for high‑stakes responses, and clinician review queues. All changes go through evaluation suites and safety council approval.

## 5) Handling Bias & Cultural Fit

- Answer: Data minimization first. We audit outputs across demographic test sets; support locale‑aware phrasing and cultural norms. Provide user override (“that’s not me”) to steer future responses; escalate to human when mismatch persists. We avoid clinical labels and disclose limitations.

## 6) LMS/SIS Integrations at Scale

- Answer: LTI 1.3 for launch; Assignments & Grades Service for outcomes. Rostering via OneRoster/Ed‑Fi or Clever/ClassLink. We run imports in BullMQ with backoff and DLQ; idempotent upserts on `source:externalId`. Webhooks trigger partial sync; nightly full reconciliation ensures correctness.

## 7) Observability & SLOs

- Answer: OpenTelemetry traces from browser to API to queue/DB; logs with redaction; metrics with SLIs (availability, latency, error rate). SLOs: API 99.9% uptime, P95 latency < 300ms for core reads. Error budgets govern release pace.

## 8) Security Hardening

- Answer: Secrets in a vault; short‑lived JWTs with rotation; mTLS for internal services (where supported). Next.js middleware enforces auth; CSRF on mutations; CSP with strict `script-src` nonces. Regular dependency scanning and SAST.

## 9) Data Governance & Privacy

- Answer: Role‑based access via least privilege; private flags and audits stored separately. Consent flows at feature granularity (e.g., emotion detection). Data retention policies with anonymization for analytics; DSR tooling for export/delete under admin oversight.

## 10) Cost & Unit Economics

- Answer: Heaviest costs are model inference and storage. We batch/stream inference, prefer small finetunes over LLMs for routine tasks, and cache embeddings. Cold storage for old media; lifecycle policies on object store. Per‑tenant cost dashboards drive pricing tiers.

## 11) Internationalization at Depth

- Answer: ICU message format with locale packs; number/date/currency formatting; RTL support; culturally adjusted safety scripts. Future: on‑device TTS/STT where available; glossary to keep therapy terms consistent.

## 12) Calendar & Email Reliability

- Answer: Calendar subscriptions with watch renewals and backfill on restart. Email via SendGrid/SES with SPF/DKIM/DMARC; inbound hooks for replies; suppression lists for bounces/complaints; per‑tenant rate limiting.

## 13) Human Handoff Workflow

- Answer: One‑tap escalation opens a secure counselor room with minimal necessary context; counselors have scoped access by organization/role. Post‑session notes are separate from user journals with explicit consent.

## 14) Roadmap: 0–6–12 Months

- 0–3: SIS/LMS GA, offline journaling, crisis rails v1, calendar/email GA.
- 3–6: Multi‑lingual therapist v2, analytics dashboards, counselor console, CRDT journaling.
- 6–12: Wearables opt‑in signals, federated learning pilots, VR/AR exposure therapy modules with accessibility focus.

## 15) Vendor Limits & Backoff

- Answer: Token bucket + exponential backoff; circuit breakers for noisy neighbors; ETags for conditional GET; bulk/batch endpoints where supported.

## 16) Testing Strategy (E2E & Safety)

- Answer: Playwright E2E with network throttling/offline; contract tests for LTI/OneRoster; chaos testing for webhook retries; red‑team prompts for safety regressions; golden answers for crisis scripts.

## 17) Edge vs Region Placement

- Answer: Static + auth checks at edge; personalized data fetches in region close to the user’s data residency. WebSockets for live features terminate in region; fall back to SSE/long‑poll in constrained networks.

## 18) Guardrails Against Over‑Reliance on AI

- Answer: Persistent “support, not diagnosis” messaging; cooldowns after intense sessions; nudges to human support; visible confidence and source notes; easy opt‑out and data controls.
