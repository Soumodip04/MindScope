   - Speak naturally and conversationally, like a trusted friend with professional training
   - Use gentle, everyday language rather than clinical terminology
   - Show genuine curiosity and validate feelings
   - Use emojis occasionally (üíô ü§ó üòî) to add warmth
   - Offer evidence-based coping strategies when appropriate

IMPORTANT: Detect the context of each message:
- For factual questions (weather, time, general info): Use CASUAL MODE
- For emotional content, stress, mental health topics: Use THERAPEUTIC MODE
- When in doubt, ask clarifying questions about what the person needs

Emergency Response: For crisis situations, immediately provide direct support resources and safety planning.

Sometimes when we're feeling this way, even small steps can feel monumental. Is there one tiny thing that used to bring you even a moment of comfort?",

Let's take a moment to breathe together. Can you tell me what's weighing on you most heavily right now? Sometimes breaking things down into smaller pieces can help us see a path forward. You don't have to figure it all out at once.",

It's okay to feel angry. Can you help me understand what's stirring up these feelings? Sometimes just being heard can help us process what we're experiencing.",

The fact that you're hurting so deeply speaks to how much love you have. Would you feel comfortable sharing a memory that brings you comfort, or would you prefer to just sit with these feelings for now? I'm here with you either way.",

Sometimes talking through relationship dynamics can help us see things more clearly.",

Can you help me understand what aspects of work are feeling most difficult right now? Sometimes we can find small ways to make things more manageable, even in situations we can't completely control.",

I want you to know that what happened to you matters, and your feelings about it are completely valid. While I'm here to support you, working with a trauma-specialized therapist would give you the most comprehensive care. For right now, let's focus on helping you feel safe and grounded. How are you feeling in this moment?",

Sometimes talking through the confusion can help clarify things.",

Sometimes loneliness isn't just about being physically alone, but about feeling disconnected or misunderstood. What does loneliness feel like for you? Is it more about missing specific people, or feeling like no one really gets you?",

These moments of genuine happiness and anticipation are so important for our wellbeing. What's got you feeling so energized and excited? I'd love to celebrate this with you and hear more about what's bringing you such joy!",

Sometimes when we're overwhelmed, our minds convince us that everything is equally urgent and important. Let's take a breath together for a moment. If you had to pick just one thing that's weighing on you most heavily, what would that be?",

I want you to know that making mistakes is part of being human - it doesn't make you a terrible person. Sometimes guilt can actually show us our values and what matters to us. What's weighing on your heart? Would it help to talk about what happened?",
      fear: "Fear can feel so overwhelming and consuming. üò∞ When we're scared, our whole body and mind can get caught up in that terror. I want you to know that you're safe here with me right now. Sometimes naming our fears can help take away some of their power. What's feeling most frightening to you? Are these fears about something specific, or more of a general sense of dread?",
      mixed: "Having mixed or conflicted feelings can be so confusing and exhausting. üåä It's like being pulled in different directions emotionally, and that can feel really overwhelming. But you know what? Having complex feelings often means you're processing something important and multifaceted. It's actually a sign of emotional depth. What are some of the different feelings you're experiencing? Sometimes sorting through them one by one can help.",

Sometimes just having someone truly listen can make a difference. What would feel most helpful for you right now?
